pip install requests

Remember to install these in the file directory terminal BEFORE use

You can do so by installing VS Code (Visual Studio Code) since they have a built in terminal 
you can easily use. If you dont or dont want to install, then get out of here becuase this is for real coders 
and developers who have the skills.

Sorr for my grammer, i am typing fast since i am rushed, but hope you enjoy!

To start:

python3 main.py

when it finishes, it should say "device is reachable", if it says "device unreachable" then its
a fail and the device does not use a OS (windows, macOS, linux, darwin, etc) and therefor cannot pull info
it will give you this if it fully works and the IP is from a real device: 
I did not add the geo info for obvious reasons, but the -- is just an example, though
you will see totally different info that is actually for the given IP, you can see and try some in sample-ip.txt


enter IP: (you will put your IP you want to pull info from here)
(Ip you entered goes here) is reachable.
