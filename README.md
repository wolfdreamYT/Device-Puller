this is a device puller, a program i created to find out all the info of a device using its IP address, which can be descovered in angryIP scanner. Please use this for educational purposes only, and please dont screw around. 
This is not to screw around, because this code can actaully reveal a users real location, such as their home, address, general location, and more.

Thankyou for waiting so long for me to make more content, i might make a video about it, but i will wait and see how many views this gets.

INSTRUCTIONS:

installing: 

pip install ipinfo

pip install requests

Running:

python3 main.py


Thankyou once again, and bye bye!
